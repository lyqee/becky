    <h1 class="about-header">about me</h1>
    <span class="about1">
    <span class="highlight">People often describe me as a very quiet, introverted person.</span>
    I find strength in listening and observing the world around me. 
    I enjoy nature, yet I would rather be in my room than out anywhere else.
    </span>

    <span class="about2">
    I have a profound love for art, finding beauty and inspiration in every aspect of life. 
    To me, art is not confined to galleries and museums; it is everywhereâ€”in the colors of a sunset, 
    the patterns of city streets, and the details of nature.
    <span class="highlight">Being a seemingly reserved person, art helps me express myself when I struggle with communication.</span>
    </span>

    <span class="about3">
    In the background above is my adorable pet dog, Penny. <span class="highlight">She is one of the few
    things that I adore the most in my entire life.</span> She is 8 years old this year, she has been by my side
    for almost half my life!
    </span>

    <h1 class="about-header">my values</h1>
    <span>
    At the core of everything I do is a 
    profound sense of compassion. <span class="highlight">I believe in empathy 
    and kindness as the driving forces behind meaningful change. Understanding the struggles of others and responding with genuine care is essential to my personal and professional life.</span>
    </span>

    </div>
</div>

<div class="hobby-content">
    <div class="hobby-text">
    <h1 class="hobby-header">my hobbies</h1>
    <span class="hobby1">
        <span class="highlight">I love to draw and doodle. Here is one of my sketches.</span> I especially love drawing characters and animals,
    because there are so many different ways to express them. Drawing calms me down and keeps my mind occupied,
    another reason why I love to draw. 
    </span>

    <span class="hobby2">
    I was actually interested in pursuing art, however I got really burnt out from my art exam in secondary school. 
    Art is the most fun when there aren't rules to follow. So I figured it is best to leave art 
    as my hobby instead.
    </span>

    <span class="hobby3">
    Creating my own website was really fun for me, although it took me quite some time to learn everything. 
    From thinking about how I want my site to look, to successfully executing it and making it look good made 
    this project really exciting. Combining both creativity and coding made me more happy to do this assessment, 
    rather than the usual dread.
    </span>

    <span class="hobby4">
    Other than drawing, I have other art related hobbies. Such as crocheting, needle felting, painting, and I'll be
    learning how to knit and sew during the holidays. Pottery is also another hobby I want to pursue, but given the amount of free time I have,
    it is not possible for now.
