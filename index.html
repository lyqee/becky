  <h1 class="poverty-header">Poverty is everywhere...</h1> 
  <span class="poverty1">
  Over 700 million people live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. 
  Nearly half of these are children facing malnutrition, lack of education, and poor healthcare. Poverty is more severe in rural areas, 
  home to 80% of those affected. Economic inequality amplifies the problem, with the wealthiest 1% holding more wealth than the poorest 50% combined.
  </span>

  <span class="poverty2">
  People living in poverty endure immense suffering that encompasses every aspect of their lives. 
  From the lack of access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, and adequate shelter to the absence of essential healthcare services, their daily existence is a constant struggle. 
  </span>
  <span class="poverty3">Together, we can break the cycle of povertyâ€”join us in spreading awareness and taking action to create a brighter, more equitable future for all.</span>
